Required:\\
5 scouts\\
a pile of socks\\
Script:\\
Scout 1: (could be a leader instead) Hey, everybody! Our new socks have arrived! Come and get 'em!\\
(other scouts run onstage and line up to receive socks.)\\
\\
Scout 1: OK, Johnny, how many socks do you need?\\
Scout 2: I need 2 pair.\\
Scout 1: Just two?\\
Scout 2: Yes, I wear one pair for a week while the other pair is in the dirty wash.\\
Scout 1: Yuch! Oh well, here you go.\\
\\
Scout 3: I need 4 pair.\\
Scout 1: Why 4 pair?\\
Scout 3: I put on a fresh pair on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.\\
Scout 1: Well, that's better than wearing them a whole week. Here you go.\\
\\
Scout 4: I need 7 pair.\\
Scout 1: Great. I bet that's a fresh pair every day, right? (gives the socks)\\
Scout 4: Right!\\
Scout 1: That's what I like. A clean scout! Here you go.\\
\\
Scout 5: 12 pair please!\\
Scout 1: 12!? Man, you must really be clean. Why 12 pair?\\
Scout 5: Well, there's January, February, March, ..\\
