To the tune of “Oh My Darling, Clementine” \\

\begin{verse}
Found a peanut, found a peanut, found a peanut just now. \\
Just now I found a peanut, found a peanut just now. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Cracked it open, cracked it open, cracked it open just now \\
Just now I cracked it open, cracked it open just now. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
It was rotten, it was rotten, it was rotten just now, \\
Just now it was rotten, it was rotten just now. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Ate it anyway \\
Got a stomachache \\
Called the doctor \\
(he) Had me drink soup \\
Took a nap \\
Was a dream \\
Then I woke up \\
Walked to School \\
Found a peanut \\
\end{verse}
