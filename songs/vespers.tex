\songtitle{Scout Vespers}

(sung to the tune of “O’ Christmas Tree”)\\

\begin{verse}
Softly falls the light of day\\
As our campfire fades away.\\
Silently each Scout should ask:\\
Have I done my daily task?\\
Have I kept my honor bright?\\
Can I guiltless sleep tonight?\\
Have I done and have I dared\\
Everything to be prepared?
\end{verse}
