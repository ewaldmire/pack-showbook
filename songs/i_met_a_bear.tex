\songtitle{I Met A Bear}

From: https://www.scoutsongs.com/lyrics/imetabear.html\\

The other day, I met a bear,\\
A great big bear, Oh way out there.\\

Chorus:\\
(Same lines in unison)\\

He looked at me, I looked at him,\\
He sized up me, I sized up him.\\

He said to me, "Why don't you run?\\
I see you ain't, Got any gun."\\

I says to him, "That's a good idea."\\
"Now legs get going, get me out of here!"\\

And so I ran, Away from there,\\
But right behind me, Was that bear.\\

In front of me, There was a tree,\\
A great big tree, Oh glory be!\\

The lowest branch, Was ten feet up,\\
So I thought I'd jump, And trust my luck.\\

And so I jumped, Into the air,\\
But I missed that branch, A way up there.\\

Now don't you fret, And don't you frown,\\
I Caught that branch, On the way back down!\\

This is the end, There aint no more,\\
Unless I see, That bear once more.
