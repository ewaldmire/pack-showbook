\songtitle{The Boa Constrictor Song}

based on a story by Shel Silverstein\\

Oh NO, he's up to my TOES\\

Oh GEE, he's up to my KNEES\\

Oh MY, he's up to my THIGH\\

Oh FIDDLE, he's up to my MIDDLE\\

Oh HECK, he's up to my NECK\\

OH DREAD, he's up to my *GULP!!*

\begin{center}
\textit{Chorus:} \\
I'm being eaten by a Boa Constrictor\\
I'm being eaten by a Boa Constrictor\\
I'm being eaten by a Boa Constrictor\\
and I DON'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH!
\end{center}
